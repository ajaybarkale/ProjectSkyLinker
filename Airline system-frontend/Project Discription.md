# Airline Reservation System
    The Airline Reservation System is an essential component of the aviation 
industry, enabling efficient management of flight bookings, passenger information, 
and seat allocation. This project presents the design and development of an 
advanced Airline Reservation System that aims to streamline the booking process, 
enhance passenger experience, and improve operational efficiency for airlines. 
The proposed system encompasses a user-friendly web-based interface for 
passengers to search, select, and book flights according to their preferences. It 
incorporates a comprehensive database that stores information about flights, 
airports, available seats, and passenger details.
